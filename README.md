# TPM-module-of-often-used-functions
Functions I have written that I use in all of my calculations.  Most of them are simple, and their existence as functions save me from having to type more!


 'anomalies',  Calculates daily, monthly, seasonal, annual anomalies<br>
 'arclength',  Calculates the arc-length between points on a sphere<br>
 'fill_year',  Appends NaNs to a dataset to make a complete year of data<br>
 'find_latlon',          I haven't used this for a while.  Probably finds gridpoints with values exceeding a threshold<br>
 'plot_vertical_lines',  Plots vertical lines<br>
 'space_longitudes',     An attempt to adjust the aspect ratio to take in to account the convergence of meridians on a sphere<br>
 'threetotwo',           Converts a 3-dimensional to a 2-dimensional array<br>
 'time_shift',           Subsets, prepends NaNs, and or appends NaNs to a timeseries or array to make the data the desired span<br>
 'write_ts',             Write monthly or annual time series out in as an ascii file<br>
 'yearsmonths',          Monthly values of year and month for input year(s)<br>
 'yearsmonthsdays'.      Daily values of year, month, day of month, Julian day (1-365/366) for input year(s)<br>
